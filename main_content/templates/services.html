            <p>Piano Studio Kft offers a piano tuning service within 24 hours in most cases.</p>

            <p>We offer up to 30% discount if more pianos are ordered at the same place or in case of a long term contract.</p>

            <h4>How many times should I have my piano tuned?</h4>
            <p>Most pianos should be tuned twice a year. Pianos that are used for performance or for recording will need to be tuned more often.</p>

            <h4>How long does it take?</h4>
            <p>The tuning procedure takes about one and a half hours. The technician also inspects the piano while tuning and warns you in time if your piano needs extra care.</p>

            <h4>Renovation</h4>
            <img class="right-teaser" src="{% static 'pictures/st.jpg' %}" alt="Piano Pins" />
            <p>In most cases a complete restoration of a valuable piano will cost much less than the price of a new one! A complete restoration includes internal renovation and refinishing (both might be ordered separately too).</p>

            <h5>Internal renovation</h5>
            <p>The full process of renovating the internal parts of a piano takes about two weeks for a technician and includes the following main steps: Pin block replacement, Refinishing the plate, Repairs done to the bridges and sound board, Refinishing the sound board, Restringing with new strings (hand-wound bass strings, only the finest quality german iron strings), Reconditioning the piano action (new set of hammers, etc...)</p>
            <h5>Refinishing</h5>
            <p>In order to bring the piano to it's original look we usually do the following: Strip the old finish down, Sand entire piano and parts, Correct any harm done to the wood during the years, Apply color, Apply lacquer or polyester finish, Install new hardware (pedals, hinges, knobs, etc...)</p>
